## Hi, my name is Bruno Marciano! ðŸ‘‹

âœ… I'm 32 years old and from TaboÃ£o da Serra - SP.

In early 2023, I made the decision to become a technology professional.
I started studying Systems Analysis and Development, which I am still studying and I really identified with the area of â€‹â€‹Front End Programming.

Today, in addition to college, I take extra courses focused on the Front End area, always looking for new knowledge and challenges.

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

  **My performance:** Manual Testing and Automation.

  **Frameworks:** Excel, Azure, Postman, VsCode, Javascript and
