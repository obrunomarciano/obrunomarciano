## Hi, my name is Bruno Marciano! ðŸ‘‹

âœ… I'm 32 years old, from SP and currently looking for my career transition.

At the beginning of 2023, I made the decision to become a technology professional. So, I soon started a higher education course that I am still working on and, having learned about it during this period, I really identified with the area of â€‹â€‹Quality Assurance.

Today, in addition to college, I take an extra course focused on the QA area, and with this, I hope to contribute to all my learning and thus guarantee my long-awaited career transition.
